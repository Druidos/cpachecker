Libraries Used by CPAchecker
============================

Binary Libraries
----------------

Binary libraries should be provided via Ivy.

All libraries in the directory `lib/java/` are managed by Apache Ivy.
To add libraries there, add them to the file `ivy.xml`.
Do not store any file in that directory, Ivy will delete it!
To generate a report listing all libraries managed by Ivy,
call `ant report-dependencies`.

For all other libraries and tools, document them here.
License and copyright need to be declared in a `.license` file
as supported by the `reuse` tool.
